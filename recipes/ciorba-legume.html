    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>120g</strong> of onion (a large onion), diced</li>
        <li><strong>75g</strong> of carrot (1 medium-sized carrot), diced</li>
        <li><strong>40g</strong> of celery (a piece the size of a small egg), diced</li>
        <li><strong>75g</strong> of pepper, diced</li>
        <li><strong>60g</strong> of grated potato</li>
        <li><strong>150g</strong> of diced potatoes</li>
        <li><strong>150g</strong> of peeled tomatoes (or from a can of tomatoes in broth)</li>
        <li><strong>120g</strong> of cauliflower torn into small florets, enough to fit in a spoon</li>
        <li><strong>100g</strong> of green beans, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> of oil</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> bunch of green parsley</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> link of walnut</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to prepare!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 1.7 liters of water over the vegetables in the pot. To speed up the boiling of the soup, we can add warm water. After the soup boils, it is seasoned with a teaspoon of salt, so that the vegetables boiling in it take on a little taste, then cauliflower is added, which, of all the vegetables used, boils the hardest.</li>
        <li>After about 2-3 minutes, add the diced potato.</li>
        <li>After the cauliflower and potato are half cooked (when tasted they feel soft but still retain some texture) add the green beans.</li>
        <li>After this is also cooked, add the peeled and diced tomatoes and boil the vegetable soup for a few more minutes, no more than 4-5 minutes, then turn off the heat and adjust the salty, peppery and sour taste.
        </li>
        <li>Chop the greens and sprinkle the soup generously, reserving the chopped greens for sprinkling on the plate, just before serving. Cover the pot with the vegetable soup with the lid and let it sit for 10 minutes before serving, so that it breathes and the flavors of the greens infuse into the juice.
        </li>
    </ol>
